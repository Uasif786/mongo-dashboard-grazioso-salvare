Developer Reflection
How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
To write maintainable, readable, and adaptable programs, I follow best practices such as meaningful variable naming, consistent indentation, modular design, and thorough code commenting. In Project One, I created a reusable AnimalShelter class to handle all CRUD operations with MongoDB. Because the class used parameterized methods and clean separation of concerns, I was able to reuse it directly in Project Two when building the dashboard.

This modular design reduced redundancy and made the dashboard development process more efficient. In the future, I could easily reuse this CRUD module in other animal tracking or rescue applications that rely on MongoDB — it’s adaptable and extensible for other domains as well.

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist?
I approach problems by breaking them down into smaller, manageable tasks and identifying the best tools to solve each part. For this project, I started by understanding the dashboard specifications and the rescue filtering requirements. I then mapped each requirement to its corresponding component in the MVC pattern — database (model), Python CRUD functions (controller), and Dash layout and callbacks (view).

Compared to past assignments, this project required more full-stack thinking and real-world application design. I focused on reusability, performance, and user experience — strategies I plan to continue using when developing future client applications or scalable database systems.

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter?
Computer scientists solve complex real-world problems using logical thinking, data, and technology. In this project, I developed a dashboard that helps Grazioso Salvare quickly identify and train suitable rescue dogs — a process that could directly impact life-saving operations. By providing data filtering, visualization, and interactivity, my work helps the company make faster, more informed decisions. This is the true value of computer science: transforming data into actionable insight that improves human lives.
